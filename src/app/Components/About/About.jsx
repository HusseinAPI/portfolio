        Hello! I’m Hussein Kassab, a passionate and dedicated full-stack
        developer with expertise in MERN Stack, MySQL, TypeScript, Next.js, and
        more. I am always striving to build robust and scalable web applications
        that solve real-world problems. I hold a bachelor’s degree in
        Information Technology from Amjad Institutes, which provided me with a
        strong foundation in computer science and programming principles. After
        completing an intensive full-stack development bootcamp with ESA Coding
        Lab, I participated in several projects with team collaborations, which
        helped me refine my technical and communication skills. These projects
        were part of my bootcamp experience, where I gained practical knowledge
        of working in agile environments and delivering high-quality solutions.
        I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my
        skills and stay updated with industry trends. Whether working
        independently or as part of a team, I bring a growth mindset and a
        commitment to excellence in every project. When I’m not coding, I enjoy
        reading and playing football.

        Although I am at the beginning of my professional journey as a
        Full-Stack Developer, I have acquired comprehensive skills and knowledge
        through rigorous training. I successfully completed the Full-Stack
        Development bootcamp with ESA Coding Lab, which included both individual
        and team-based projects, providing hands-on experience in various
        technologies and methodologies. I hold two certifications in Full-Stack
        Development: ESA Business School: Full-Stack Developers ESIEE-IT France:
        Full-Stack Developers In addition to my certifications, I have worked on
        numerous projects, both personal and collaborative, which showcase my
        ability to build and deploy web applications, from front-end development
        to back-end implementation. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in
        technologies such as the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js),
        Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and Next.js. I am passionate about continuous
        learning and am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting to
        contribute to innovative projects.
